# Matrix Calculator

A web-based Matrix Calculator for my Linear Algebra project that allows users to perform various matrix operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, transpose, determinant, and inverse. The website provides an interactive interface to input matrices, select operations, and display results.

## Features

- **Matrix Addition**: Add two matrices.
- **Matrix Subtraction**: Subtract one matrix from another.
- **Matrix Multiplication**: Multiply two matrices.
- **Matrix Transpose**: Transpose a matrix.
- **Matrix Determinant**: Calculate the determinant of a matrix.
- **Matrix Inverse**: Compute the inverse of a matrix (if possible).

## How to Use

1. **Select the Operation**: Choose one of the available matrix operations from the dropdown menu (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Transpose, Determinant, Inverse).
2. **Set Matrix Dimensions**: Define the number of rows and columns for Matrix A (and Matrix B, for operations like addition, subtraction, and multiplication).
3. **Enter Matrix Values**: Input numeric values into the generated matrix input fields.
4. **Generate Matrix Inputs**: Click the button to generate the input fields for Matrix A (and Matrix B if needed).
5. **Calculate**: Click the "Calculate" button to perform the selected matrix operation. The result will be displayed in matrix form.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/matrix-calculator.git
